# School-Accounts-Manager
Tool for managing student and staff in  K-12 AD/Google Apps environment

I am open to suggestions along the way. Feel free to open an issue with a request.


## Current Functionality
1. AD Authentication
1. 4 user priviledge levels
1. Google Apps Integration via GAM
1. Active Directory Integration via PowerShell
1. Based on SIF standard school OU stucture (school->students->yog)
1. Create and manage student and staff users of GA and AD
1. Email notifications of actions
1. Very mobile friendly
1. Other Tech Support related tools
1. Elegant UI with clean design
