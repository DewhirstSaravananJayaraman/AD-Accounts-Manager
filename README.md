# School-Accounts-Manager
Tool for managing student and staff in  K-12 AD/Google Apps environment



I am still working on converting this application from a purpose built system to something more generic and configurable.

I am open to suggestions along the way. Feel free to open an issue with a request.

## CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT
This app is not done. It is fully functional on my systems, but as I said I need to generalize and streamline the code.

If you try this out during this development phase, you may need to delete the config file found at /config/config.json if you update by overwrite.

## Current Functionality
1. AD Authentication
1. 4 user priviledge levels
1. Google Apps Integration via GAM
1. Active Directory Integration via PowerShell
1. Based on SIF standard school OU stucture (school->students->yog)
1. Create and manage student and staff users of GA and AD
1. Email notifications of actions
1. Very mobile friendly
1. Other Tech Support related tools
1. Elegant UI with clean design
1. Currently only PK-8 implemented
